# Skin-Cancer-Prediction-App-With-ML
Skin cancer is a pressing global health issue. Detection of skin cancer in time can have a significant impact on treatment as well as the outcome of patients. Addressing this, our machine learning model represents an automated system that can classify three common skin cancer types: Basal Cell Carcinoma, Melanoma, and Pigmented Benign Keratosis from input image. The proposed system contains Image preprocessing, Feature extraction, and classification. It is evaluated on a publicly available skin cancer dataset, which leads to promising accuracy. It also has a web app to visualize the model, where users can give input images to detect cancer types. This early detection approach showed the potential of Machine learning in early cancer detection
